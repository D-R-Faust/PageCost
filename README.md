# PageCost
See how much the MFP managing companies are screwing you via passive income from each page printed

It's just a simple copy/paste script you can use in powershell ISE.
Pretty straight forward, it takes cost (decimal) input and then a number of pages (generally what your average monthly usage is), then multiplies every year by 10% (industry standard), for the next 7 years (industry standard for replacing printers is every 5-7 years)

Just one printer at a time. If you have LOTS of printers it may behoove you to just throw the entire program in another loop and add each output.
